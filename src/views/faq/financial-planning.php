                                    <p>Financial planning is no different from a structured problem solving framework.
                                        Every structured business problem solving exercises has specific steps (the same
                                        can be applied in financial planning as well). However, there are broadly 6
                                        steps in the financial planning process. Most certified financial planners
                                        (CFPs) and financial advisers will be very familiar with these steps. However,
                                        investors should understand that, while financial planners or CFPs can play an
                                        important role in the financial planning process, the success of the financial
                                        plan ultimately depends on the investor. Therefore, it will be useful for
                                        investors to familiarize themselves with the process, so that they can work
                                        efficiently and effectively with their financial planners or advisers.</p>
                                    <h6>Step - 1: Understanding and defining the life goals</h6>
                                    <p>The first step of financial planning process is to understand and define your
                                        specific goals. The more specific the goals are the better it is. Sometimes, you
                                        may not have enough clarity about all the financial goals in your life. An
                                        expert financial planner can help you define the goals across your savings and
                                        investment lifecycle and determine the specific numbers you need to reach for
                                        each of the specific goals. You should remember that a financial plan is not
                                        working towards a singular goal, like retirement planning, Children's education
                                        or marriage or buying a home etc. </p>
                                    <p>A financial plan includes multiple goals across your savings and investment
                                        lifecycle. However, you should establish definite time frames for achievement of
                                        each of these goals. Even though, ideally, we would like to achieve or even
                                        exceed all our financial goals, it is useful to prioritize the goals, especially
                                        if there are constraints with regards to how much you can invest and save. For
                                        example, you may prioritize your child's higher education over buying a house or
                                        some other financial goals. The financial planner will take your priority into
                                        consideration, when developing your financial plan. Once the financial goals and
                                        the priorities are determined, the financial planner or adviser will examine
                                        these goals in respect to your resources and other constraints, if any. The
                                        objective of this step is to help you define specific, realistic, actionable
                                        financial goals.</p>
                                    <h6>Step - 2: Collecting and consolidating data through personal meeting</h6>
                                    <p>The second step in the financial planning process is to collect the data
                                        regarding the your income, expenses, existing fixed and financial assets, life
                                        and health insurance, lifestyle &amp; other important expenses, your family
                                        structure and other liabilities that will form the inputs in your financial
                                        plan. The Financial planner may employ different methods to collect the data
                                        from you. Some financial planners or advisers may send you a survey form or
                                        questionnaire that you will have to filled out and send back to the financial
                                        planner.</p>
                                    <p>Many financial planners prefer face to face meetings with their clients to
                                        collect this data. Face to face meetings is often more effective than just
                                        sending a survey form or questionnaire. Through a face to face interaction, the
                                        financial planner or adviser can clarify certain details about you that the
                                        questionnaire may not be able to. A personal meeting also helps the investors
                                        clarify doubts, expectations or share additional details with their financial
                                        planners or advisers. We recommend that, you should have a face to face meeting,
                                        even if your financial planner does not ask for one. It is always helpful for
                                        you.</p>
                                    <p>Whatever the method is for interaction and data gathering, it is always
                                        beneficial for you to share as much information as possible with your financial
                                        planner. Withholding financial or other important information from him is never
                                        useful. You should remember that the role of the financial planner or adviser is
                                        very much like a family physician. Just like, we should share all medical and
                                        health related information with our family physician, we should share all our
                                        financial information or any other information that may potentially have an
                                        impact on our financial situation with our financial planner</p>
                                    <h6>Step - 3: Detailed analysis and suggestions</h6>
                                    <p>The third step of the financial planning process is the data analysis part. The
                                        financial planner will review your financial situation - assets &amp;
                                        liabilities, current cash flow statements, debt or loan situation, existing
                                        insurance policies (both life and non-life insurance), exiting savings &amp;
                                        investments and other legal documents (if required). Through a structured
                                        financial analysis process, the financial planner will determine your asset
                                        allocation strategy and insurance (life and health/ critical illness) needs to
                                        meet your financial objectives. The financial planner may also suggest
                                        additional life and health insurance, if he or she determines, based on your
                                        financial analysis, that you are not adequately insured. </p>
                                    <p>What is your responsibility at this stage? While all the work in this step is
                                        done by the financial planner, as an investor, you should also involve yourself
                                        in this process by scheduling review of the plan and making sure that you
                                        understand the analysis. After all, it is your financial plan!</p>
                                    <h6>Step - 4: Asset allocation strategies and investment recommendations</h6>
                                    <p>After the above 3 steps are covered, your financial planner will make the actual
                                        recommendation with respect to your comprehensive financial plan. This will
                                        include your asset allocation strategy based on your risk profile, alternate
                                        investment options like, mutual funds, equities, traditional debts, tax saving
                                        strategies, life and non-life insurance requirements etc. Your financial planner
                                        should schedule a meeting with you, to discuss these recommendations. This is a
                                        very important step in the whole process as you should make sure that you
                                        understand all the recommendations he or she has made and the reasons thereof.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>At this stage, you should ask him/ her as many questions as you would like to,
                                        regarding each strategy or product investment recommendations, because they will
                                        be crucial in meeting your financial objectives. You should note that the final
                                        investment decisions rest with you, and therefore you should ensure that you are
                                        comfortable with the financial plan drawn and its execution strategy.
                                        Recommendations can change during this step and altered based on your inputs to
                                        the financial planner.</p>
                                    <h6>Step - 5: Filing up the necessary investment forms and understanding terms &amp;
                                        conditions</h6>
                                    <p>The penultimate step of the financial planning process is the implementation of
                                        the investor's financial plan. This involves the actual process of purchasing
                                        the investment and insurance or other products. At this stage various regulatory
                                        and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled, depending on the each product
                                        involved. As an investor, you may have to submit the documentation for Know Your
                                        Client (KYC), fill up the application forms for mutual funds, opening of Demat
                                        and share trading accounts for equity investing, and finalising proposal forms
                                        for life and non-life insurance plans. </p>
                                    <p>Your financial adviser will play a big role in fulfilling these requirements,
                                        including collecting the documents for KYC and helping you in filling out the
                                        application or proposal forms. However, it is important, that you remain
                                        involved in the entire process. Even if you delegate the responsibility of
                                        filling the major portions of your application or proposal forms to your
                                        financial advisor, please make sure that you verify the information in the forms
                                        post they are filled up, to ensure correctness of the information. You should
                                        also carefully read the brochures/ scheme information documents of the products
                                        that you are investing in, so that you understand all the terms and conditions
                                        of the product(s). </p>
                                    <h6>Step - 6: Track investments and review the financial plan regularly</h6>
                                    <p>The final step of the financial planning process is to monitor and track the
                                        progress made on your financial plan. You should review your financial plan in
                                        order to evaluate the effect of changes in your income levels, your financial
                                        situation, tax obligations, new tax rules, new products and changes in market
                                        conditions. Normally, your financial planner should schedule meetings with you
                                        at a regular frequency (once every 6 month or 12 months) to review your
                                        portfolio and discuss if any change needs to be made in your financial plan,
                                        asset allocation strategies and investments. </p>
                                    <p>But even if your financial planner does not schedule regular review meetings, you
                                        should insist on meeting with him/ her at some regular frequency, e.g.
                                        Semi-annually or annually etc. At the end of the day, it is your financial plan
                                        and your financial future is at stake. Therefore, the onus is really on you, to
                                        make sure that your financial plan is on track. Also, you should remember that
                                        financial planning is not a static, but a dynamic exercise. Your financial
                                        situation, goals and aspirations may change over a period of time. Therefore,
                                        you should meet with your financial planner or adviser on a regular basis, to
                                        ensure that your portfolio is doing well and at the same time, ensure that any
                                        change to your financial situation, goals or aspirations is appropriately
                                        reflected in your financial plan, and executed upon.</p>

                                    <p>The first step of financial planning is to define specific goals. The more
                                        specific the goals are the better. As an investor, especially if you are young,
                                        you may not have enough clarity about all the financial goals in your life. This
                                        is where an expert financial planner helps you. Through a financial planning
                                        process, the biggest benefit is that you can define the goals across your
                                        savings and investment lifecycle and save towards it for achieving the different
                                        life goals. Investing or saving without knowing the goals is like embarking on a
                                        journey without knowing the destination.</p>

                                    <p>The next benefit of financial planning is budgeting. This is probably the most
                                        important step of financial planning, but also the most ignored one. Even if you
                                        have the most detailed and well-structured financial plan, if you are not able
                                        to save enough, you will not be able to meet your financial goals. Saving habits
                                        are very personal, depending on your lifestyle, relative to your income levels.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While the financial planner may not actually prepare your budget, he or she can
                                        help you give you guidance on how to prepare one. Budgeting is not a hugely time
                                        consuming exercise. While preparing your budget, you should try, as much as
                                        possible, not to skip minor details, because through a careful budgeting you may
                                        be able to identify expenses, which you can easily reduce, without any
                                        noticeable impact on your lifestyle.</p>
                                    <p>Remember, through budgeting even if you can make a small additional savings. It
                                        will have a big difference to your long term wealth as power of compounding
                                        helps over long term. Just to give you an example, even an additional Rs 500
                                        monthly savings, invested in equity assets yielding 20% return, will generate a
                                        corpus in excess of Rs 1 Crore over 30 years. Therefore, financial plan teaches
                                        you the importance of budgeting and helps you save more.</p>

                                    <p>How you invest your save (debt or equity or real estate), plays a very important
                                        role in ensuring the success of your goals. Different asset classes have
                                        different risk return characteristics. Too much risk can result in loss of
                                        money, while too little risk may prevent you from meeting your long term
                                        financial objectives. While drawing your financial plan the emphasis is on Asset
                                        allocation which is the process of balancing your risk and return objectives.

                                    <p>Having a financial plan helps you prepare for risks. Risks are unforeseen events
                                        that can cause financial distress. The worst case contingency is an untimely
                                        death, which can result in financial distress for the family, apart from the
                                        emotional trauma. Financial planning can help us prepare for such contingencies
                                        through adequate life insurance. Another contingency is serious illness that can
                                        have an impact on your savings and consequently your short term or long term
                                        financial objectives. A good financial plan will make adequate provisions for
                                        health insurance and critical illness. There can also be other contingencies
                                        like temporary loss of income or major unforeseen expenditures. Financial plans
                                        helps you prepare for such contingencies.</p>

                                        come under the ambit of tax. Tax planning starts when a person starts working
                                        and continues almost through-out one's life, even after retirement. Different
                                        investment products are subject to different tax treatments. Financial planning
                                        can not only help you save taxes (under Section 80C, Section 80CCD, Section 80D

                                        you a head start in meeting your financial objectives even earlier. Saving and
                                        investment is not the most important priority for many young professionals.
                                        While lifestyle is an important consideration for many young people, you should
                                        be careful to not build a liability in your personal balance sheet. Economic
                                        lessons learnt from the west over the past 2 decades have taught us that we can
                                        easily get into debt trap without even realizing. Young people should think long
                                        term, because a small amount of money saved now can create wealth for you in the

                                        savings and investment on autopilot mode, with minimal impact on your lifestyle.
                                        You will realize the benefits of early financial planning, when you approach
                                        important life goals, like buying your house, funding your children's higher
                                        education, your own retirement etc. Early start can also help you buy adequate
                                        life and health insurance at much lower premium as the premiums rise rapidly as
                                        your age increases.</p>
